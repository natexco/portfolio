      <td><p>Stephen Curry is a point guard for the Golden State Warriors, and he has been the most consistent player of that team. He has only had 3 seasons where he had less than a 20 point average, which is 13 seasons played with a 20+ point average. He had the deepest 3 of his era and was known for always shooting 3's with his signature jumper. He has won a total of 4 championships, 1 finals mvp, 2 nba most valuable player awards, and 4 olympic medals.
Honorable mentions: Steve nash,  Russel westbrook</p></td>
<td><p>Tim Duncan played for the San Antonio Spurs and was a prodigy before he even knew it. He pursued swimming before he played basketball, so he wasnst crazy about it. But for someone who's won 5 out of the 6 finals they've been to is impressive for someone like him. He has won 1 rookie of the year, 5 championships, 3 DPOY, and an NBA all defensive team.
Honorable mentions: Giannis Antentokounmpo, Kevin Durant</p>
</td>
<td><p>LeBron James is the greatest player of the 21st century. He is the only player to play every position, the only team to come back 3-1 in the finals, and the only player to play with their son on the same team. Being drafted to the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2003, later going to the Miami Heat, coming back to the Cavaliers, and then to the Lakers he has won 4 championships. He is often compared to Michael Jordan because people cannot decide whoâ€™s better. He has won 4 MVPs, 4 FMVPs, ROTY, 3 Olympic medals, and many more.
Honorable mentions: Kawhi Leonard, Kobe Bryant</p>
